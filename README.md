# AstroJumPy ![AstroJump] (https://github.com/theRoughCode/AstroJumPy/blob/master/android-icon.png)

Side project I worked on while waiting for University to start.  I began this side project to help me learn Python and mobile game development.  Python has a few libraries that allows developers to create mobile games, such as PyGame which I used.  However, PyGame is a relatively new library with not as many features as compared to Android Studio.  Thus, I made the decision to migrate my code over to Java and continue development in Android Studio.  I do not regret having started this in Python as it allowed me to dig deeper into the intricacies of Python and get familiar with the syntax *(my favourite to date)*.

All artwork featured in this game were all made by me for this game.
